# 🚀 Material 3 FABs Practice – Jetpack Compose

This repository contains a comprehensive practice of **Floating Action Buttons (FABs)** using **Material 3 Expressive** in **Jetpack Compose**. The project demonstrates various FAB types, interactions, and animations to explore their behavior in real-world UI.

---

## 🧪 What I Practiced

### 🔹 Basic FAB Types

I started by implementing all standard FAB types available in Material 3:

* **FAB**
* **Extended FAB**
* **Small FAB**
* **Small Extended FAB**
* **Medium FAB**
* **Medium Extended FAB**
* **Large FAB**
* **Large Extended FAB**

Each FAB was styled with different container and content colors, icons, and shapes.

### 🔹 Long Click Listener with `InteractionSource`

I then learned how to detect **long clicks** on FABs using `InteractionSource` and `collectIsPressedAsState()` to add more interactivity. This lets you trigger custom logic when users long-press a FAB.

### 🔹 Toggle FAB

Next, I explored the **ToggleFloatingActionButton** from Material 3. This FAB reacts to toggle state changes by:

* Animating between icons
* Changing shape and color
* Providing a more **intuitive and dynamic user experience**

---

### 🔹 Expandable FAB Menu

Finally, I implemented a fully **Expandable FAB Menu** using:

* `FloatingActionButtonMenu`
* `ToggleFloatingActionButton`
* `FloatingActionButtonMenuItem`

This expandable FAB acts as a container for multiple FAB actions and displays/hides items on toggle, enabling **compact UI** with multiple quick actions.
